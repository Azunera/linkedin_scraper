Our platform - a mix of technology, people, and analytics - supports providers at the point of care, delivering real-time patient information, activating practice staff, and empowering providers and care teams with incentives that reward the work they are already doing to keep patients healthy. Using the Stellar App, our web-based, point-of-care tool; practices receive a simple checklist of recommended actions that support the best quality care. Providers and care teams are then paid monthly for each action they complete, and Payors save money in reduced healthcare costs along the way.<br><br>Stellar is a US-based Health-tech backed by Top VCs (General Atlantic, Point72, & Primary Venture Partners)</em>  with an established product & proven operating model.

Read on to learn how we are fundamentally different from our competitors.  \n\nAt Gyga Force, we adopt a distinctive method for revenue distribution and recruitment. Unlike conventional staffing agencies that offer a base salary plus commissions, we flip the model on its head: our recruiters hold a stake in the company and its client base, receiving the majority of the revenue they generate, while the company earns a commission from their earnings. This innovative approach allows us to attract former engineers as recruiters, who can potentially earn more in this role than they did as engineers. This brings invaluable experience and industry-specific technical knowledge - that only an engineer is capable of -  and enhances our effectiveness, as evidenced by our client testimonials.\n\nIn addition to our specialty recruitment services Gyga Force also provides in-house engineering design services for clients that require help with particular projects but do not want to commit to hiring additional staff. Our internal engineering staff is capable of managing complete designs, offering all-inclusive solutions that meet the demands of your project. We offer IC and FPGA design services, board/PCB level design services, embedded firmware development, as well as full stack software development.  \n\nWhether you want to add to your current skillset or need full design support, our in-house team can guarantee excellent outcomes that meet your needs. \n\nWe offer:\n\n- Recruiting for permanent hire positions\n- Temp/contract, and contract to hire positions\n- Gyga Force internal engineering design services \n\nWe cordially invite you to get in touch with us to explore our recruiting or internal design services and discover the full range of capabilities we offer.\n\n\n\n."
